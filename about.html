                <h1>Matthew R. Bowns</h1>
                <p>
                I’m a camera operator and cinematographer in the north of England. I’ve worked on numerous productions from short local history projects, 
                to shows and documentaries for national organisations such as the Churches Conservation Trust and Wentworth Woodhouse. I have experience 
                using Black Magic and Arri cameras along with extensive experience grading in DaVinci resolve.
                </p>
                <p>
                My other work includes commercials, music videos and horror short films, of which I’ve written, produced, and directed 3. I’m always 
                looking for opportunities to work with new people and try out fresh ideas.
