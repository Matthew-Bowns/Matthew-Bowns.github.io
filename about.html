                    I’ve been smitten with filmmaking since I was a kid. Watching my favourite movies was only made more interesting 
                    by learning how they were made. Seeing what went into a film fascinated me. All the people, all the equipment, 
                    and as I’ve discovered since then, all the skill. I’ve come to see it as a sort of magic. With the effort we make and 
                    the trouble we endure, all towards an end even we can’t be certain of, to finally create something that brings joy 
                    to others, what else could it possibly be? Few people really appreciate what goes into a film, but we do, and I 
                    think that makes it all the more special.

                    I’m a cinematographer and director. I like to tell people I’m from Yorkshire, because I’m grateful to have grown
                     up in such a beautiful place. I’ve worked on several short films (as writer and director) and have made a habit 
                     of producing history documentaries. I’ve made films for all sorts of people such as Wentworth Woodhouse and 
                     westwood 2015. I’ve worked with historians, youtubers, charities, archives, museums and there are probably some 
                     I’m forgetting as well.

                    If you want to know what I’m good at then the answer is documentaries, though I’m working on fiction projects 
                    as we speak. If you think I could help out, just send me an email and we can set up a call.
